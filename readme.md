# WaCoMo Dashboard

WaCoMo is a water consumption monitoring system consist of an IOT device, Cloud application and a Mobile application
The project was built for Microsoft Imagine Cup competition
Me and my team were able to reach the finals using this project. However, unfortunatly, we were not able to participate
because our visa got reject (USA travel ban).

This is only the dashboard part of the system. Therefore, you need to integrate your own API.
The dashboard is reusable if you read the code(it is documented). It can be used for anything involved with monitoring
consumption from a sensor device.
